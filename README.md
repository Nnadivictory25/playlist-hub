👨‍💻 **Some Technical Features**

- Optimistic likes on the UI using Tanstack Mutation query, so liking a playlist is instant on the UI and in the case an error occurs all updates are rolled back with some nice toast messages !
- Complete auth protection for user specific API routes, user session is checked and if unauthorized then action won't be done. Must be logged in to upload or like a playlist.
- Also composability in the code, good SOC practices and keeping the UI logic separate from the business logic
- URL state management with Nuqs for shareable filter/search states
- Server-side rendering with SvelteKit for fast initial loads
- Google OAuth authentication for easy sign-in experience
